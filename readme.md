# Trek.py
This is a simply python script to randomly select two different Star Trek episodes for you to choose between to watch.  I am not the original author of this script but I can no longer figure out where it came from, but as I've started to modify it for the new Trek coming out and I use it on multiple machines I wanted to put it on github.  If you are the original author please let me know.
